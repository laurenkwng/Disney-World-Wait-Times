# Disney World Wait Time Analysis
This project was created as a final project for our Statistical Data Science class which goes over the fundamentals of utilizing IPython for data science, while we adopt the sklearn package to develop machine learning models. Our project is divided into two different IPython notebooks. The first notebook containing our exploratory data analysis, and the second containing our predictions on the data using different machine learning models.

Data obtained was from Disney World's official tour website. It consists of multiple features such as max temperature, parade times, percentage of kids in school per given day, etc.
